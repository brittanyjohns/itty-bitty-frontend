//     To help us generate the best possible communication board, please be as specific and detailed as possible when describing your scenario. Here are some tips to guide you:

//     1. Be Specific: Instead of general descriptions like "Going to a party," try something more detailed like "Going to a birthday party for a classmate at the local park."

//     2. Include Key Details: Mention important aspects such as location, people involved, activities, or any special considerations. For example, "The party will have a treasure hunt, games, and a piñata."

//     3. Consider the Age: Think about the person’s age and what might be relevant for them in this scenario. For example, an 8-year-old's experience might include different activities than a 5-year-old's.

//     4. Think About the Environment: If applicable, describe where the event is taking place, such as "at home," "in the classroom," "at the dentist's office," or "on the playground."

//     5. Provide Context: Add any background information that might be helpful, such as "It’s their first day at a new school" or "They have been to the dentist before and know what to expect."

//     By providing a detailed description, our system can ask the right follow-up questions and generate a more accurate and useful communication board for your scenario. Thank you for helping us create the best experience possible!
